# Catch-me-if-you-can
A JavaScript program in which on hovering the box it will change it's position.

Here, I have used addEventListener (for knowing wheather mouse is hover till now or not.

Next to it, I have used getBoundingClientRect method which DOMRect object providing information 
about size of element and its position which help in moving to other position.
